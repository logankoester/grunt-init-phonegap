Fork the repo on Github and open a pull request. Note that `template.js` and `test/template_test.js` are the output of
CoffeeScript files in `src/`, and will be overwritten if edited by hand.

Likewise, `README.md` is the output of the `grunt docs` task, and will be overwritten. README updates should be made in
the Markdown files under `docs/`.

Please run `grunt build` before submitting a pull request. The build output should be included with your changes.
