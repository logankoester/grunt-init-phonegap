If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/logankoester/grunt-init-phonegap.git ~/.grunt-init/phonegap

_(Windows users, see the documentation for the correct destination directory path)_
